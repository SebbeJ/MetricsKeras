# MetricsKeras
## Introduction
This is a project for all the code in the raport for Assignment QAA. Note, these are not made for functionality. These are not scripts that are worth emaulting, but are purpose built for a particular goal. 

## Prerqusits
Note, for this code you will need to be able to execute python code. This code was also made on a mix of Linux, MacOS and windows machines, therefore some extra work may be required. Almost all of the code requires the [Keras Library](https://github.com/Uplink036/keras), linked is one of the forks that was made.

## Setup Instructions
Clone the repo using:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:keras-team/keras.git
```

Move the needed files into the root of the project or, alternatively, set the path to the project. Which one depends on the file executed. 

For the libraries needed, most will be the same as the keras libraries, with execeptions being seaborn or cprofile. A devcontainer is recomended and provided by the Keras team. It won't be explaind more here.
